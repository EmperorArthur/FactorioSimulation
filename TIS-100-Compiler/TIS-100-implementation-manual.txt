TIS-100 implementation details in factorio

Special registers:

  RW                   buffer for read and write operations to the ports

Signals:
  
  1-3                  address for next instruction, the signal number represents how many extra ticks it waits
  K                    address for next instruction, waits until read/write to port is complete
  R                    adds ACC * R to ACC, mergeable
  Q                    adds BAK * Q to BAK, mergeable
  E                    adds RW * E to RW, mergeable
  F                    adds ACC * F to RW, mergeable
  G                    adds RW * G to ACC, mergeable
  B                    adds ACC * B to BAK, mergeable
  L                    adds BAK * L to ACC, mergeable
  H                    adds ACC * RW * H to ACC, mergeable
  I                    adds (ACC / RW) * H to ACC, mergeable
  M                    adds ACC * M to ACC, mergeable
  W                    adds ACC * ACC * W to ACC, takes 3 ticks
  D                    adds ACC / D to ACC, mergeable
  V                    adds V to ACC, mergeable
  rocket-launcher = 1  jump to address ACC
  pistol               jump to address if ACC = 0
  smg                  jump to address if ACC > 0
  shotgun              jump to address if ACC < 0
  combat-shotgun       jump to address if ACC != 0
  
  J                    value to compare against on branches, takes 4 ticks to branch instead of 2
  regular-magazine     jump to address if ACC = J
  piercing-magazine    jump to address if ACC > J
  shotgun-shell        jump to address if ACC < J
  piercing-shell       jump to address if ACC != J
  
Internal Signals:

  A                    address to load instruction
  V                    value stored in ACC and BAK
  C                    value stored in RW
